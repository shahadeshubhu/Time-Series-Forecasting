#  Time Series and Forecasting 

This repository contains coursework, practicals, and projects from the *Time Series and Forecasting* module taken as part of the MSc in Data Science at the University of Nottingham.

The module introduces fundamental and advanced concepts in time series analysis, including model identification, parameter estimation, model diagnostics, and forecasting. Both time domain and frequency domain methods are explored using real-world datasets.

Key topics and skills covered include:

* Theory and properties of AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and seasonal models
* Estimation techniques, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals
* Forecasting future values and evaluating model performance
* Spectral analysis and frequency domain approaches
* Practical implementation and visualization using **R**

Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Identifying and fitting appropriate models to time series data
* Using R to conduct rigorous statistical analysis
* Interpreting results and communicating findings in technical reports

>  Learning outcomes: Derive theoretical results, apply time series models, implement estimation procedures, conduct forecasting, and interpret model diagnostics in both theoretical and applied contexts.
